Correct parameters are:
-----------------------
Parameter 1: --build OR -b (If you only want to build a compressed rootfs archive for example for later use, according to the settings in 'general_settings.sh'.)
Parameter 1: --install 'archivename' OR -i 'archivename' (if you only want to create a bootable SD-card with an already existing rootfs-package, tar.bz2 or tar.gz compressed archive)
Parameter 1: --clean all OR --clean build OR --clean cache (The first one cleans both, build and cache directories, while the other two only clean one directory respectively)
Parameter 2: --bootloader 'binary name' OR -bl 'binary name' (if you want to specify a Bootloader binary directly. It can either be a local file or link to an online source)
-----------------------
Besides that you can also run '$0' without any parameters, for the full functionality, according to the settings in 'general_settings'.
Exiting now!"
